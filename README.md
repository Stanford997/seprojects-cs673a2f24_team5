This repository is a project for METCS673. This project focuses on using AI to automate and improve the process of resume evaluation and interview preparation. By incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we ensure that our application can provide more accurate, context-relevant reviews.

## Task Management

As per github's task tracking flow is difficult to use, we decide to use [JIRA Boards](https://bu-cs673a2f24-team-5.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1) to trace the progress and manage the risk. Click the hyperlink to check details.
