# Development

## Git Branches

We have three dev branches: `dev/infra`, `dev/frontend`, `dev/backend`. The best working flow is like:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BUMETCS673/seprojects-cs673a2f24_team5.git
cd seprojects-cs673a2f24_team5/
git switch dev/** # Based on the content of your PR
# do some change
git add fileA fileB # Replace the fileA,B to your changed files
git commit -m "feat: xxx" # Please follow the semver rules, so that we can have a gentle CHANGELOG.md then.
git push
```

Then, visit the Github [PR page](https://github.com/BUMETCS673/seprojects-cs673a2f24_team5/pulls) to commit your PR.

The configuration manager(@adamma1024) will check out a release branch on the last Sunday before the iteration, so generally, you don't need to be aware of it.

## Working flows
